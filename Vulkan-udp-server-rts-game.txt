Okay, building a full-featured 3D RTS game engine from scratch in C using Vulkan, targeting both PC and Android, with procedural spherical terrain, physics, and networking is an extremely complex and ambitious project. It typically involves teams of experienced engineers working for years.

Providing complete C code for such an engine isn't feasible in this format. It would be hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of lines of code.

However, I can provide a high-level structural outline in C, mention key concepts, necessary libraries, and point you towards the major components you'll need to build or integrate.

Core Challenges:

Vulkan Verbosity: Vulkan is powerful but extremely verbose, especially in C. Setup requires meticulous handling of instances, devices, queues, swapchains, render passes, pipelines, descriptors, command buffers, synchronization, etc.
Cross-Platform Abstraction: Handling windowing, input, file systems, and Vulkan surface integration differently for PC (Windows, Linux, macOS) and Android requires careful abstraction layers.
Spherical World: Standard terrain algorithms, physics calculations (gravity towards the center), and pathfinding need adaptation for a spherical surface.
Infinite Terrain: Requires procedural generation, Level of Detail (LOD) management (e.g., spherical quadtrees/chunking), and potentially asynchronous loading/generation.
Physics on a Sphere: Integrating a physics engine and making it work correctly with gravity pulling towards the sphere's center and handling collisions on a curved surface.
Networking (RTS): Requires robust netcode, potentially deterministic lockstep or state synchronization, handling latency, and server/client architecture.
C Memory Management: Manually managing memory for all these complex systems in C is error-prone and requires discipline.
Recommended Libraries (C/C-Compatible):

Windowing/Input/Platform:
SDL2: Excellent cross-platform support (including Android), handles windowing, input, audio, threading, etc. (C library)
GLFW: Primarily focused on windowing and input for OpenGL/Vulkan. Good for PC, less direct support for Android compared to SDL. (C library)
Vulkan:
Vulkan SDK: Provides headers, loader, validation layers.
Vulkan Memory Allocator (VMA): Highly recommended library (C++ header, but usable with C) to simplify Vulkan memory allocation.
SPIRV-Cross: To reflect SPIR-V shader bytecode (needed for pipeline layouts etc.). (C++ library, C API available)
shaderc: To compile GLSL shaders to SPIR-V at runtime or build time. (C++ library, C API available)
Physics:
Bullet Physics: Mature physics engine. Primarily C++, but has a C API available although it might be less maintained or complete.
(Alternatives like PhysX, Jolt are primarily C++) You might need to write significant custom physics code or adapt parts of existing engines.
Networking:
ENet: Reliable UDP networking library. (C library)
SDL_net: Part of the SDL ecosystem. (C library)
(Raw Sockets): Possible but requires implementing reliability and ordering over UDP yourself.*
Math:
CGLM: A great, header-only C math library inspired by GLM (OpenGL Mathematics).
UI:
Dear ImGui: Excellent immediate-mode GUI library. C++ core, but has C bindings (cimgui) and Vulkan backends.
ECS (Optional but Recommended):
flecs: A fast and feature-rich Entity Component System framework for C and C++.
Build System:
CMake: Essential for managing dependencies and building cross-platform projects, especially when targeting Android (NDK).

Key Steps & Considerations:

Setup Build System (CMake): Configure CMake to handle dependencies (SDL2, Vulkan SDK, etc.) and build targets for PC (Windows, Linux) and Android (using the Android NDK).
Platform Abstraction Layer: Implement platform.h functions using SDL2 (or GLFW for PC) and Android NDK APIs (NativeActivity, JNI, AAssetManager). This is crucial for cross-platform support.
Vulkan Boilerplate: Spend significant time setting up the basic Vulkan rendering pipeline. Start with rendering a single triangle, then a textured cube. Use validation layers extensively. vkguide.dev is a great resource, though in C++. Sascha Willems' examples are also excellent (often C++ but principles apply).
Spherical Terrain Generation: Implement procedural noise (e.g., Simplex noise) mapped onto a sphere. Start with a simple icosphere or subdivided cube, displace vertices based on noise. Implement chunking/LOD.
Physics Integration: Choose a physics library or decide on custom physics. Integrate it, focusing on applying gravity towards the sphere's center.
Game Logic & RTS Features: Implement core RTS mechanics – unit creation, selection, movement commands, basic AI. Pathfinding on a sphere is non-trivial.
Networking: Design your network architecture (client-server). Choose a protocol (reliable UDP via ENet is common). Implement state synchronization or command passing. Address latency.
Android Specifics: Handle the Android lifecycle, touch input, asset loading from APKs, and ensure Vulkan works correctly on mobile GPUs (different performance characteristics, extensions).
This outline provides a starting point for the architecture. Each component is a major project in itself. Start small, focus on one piece at a time (e.g., get Vulkan rendering a sphere, then add basic terrain noise), and iterate. Good luck, this is a challenging but rewarding project!
