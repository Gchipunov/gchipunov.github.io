1. Before you begin

This codelab is deprecated and will be removed soon.

In this codelab, you build a simple musical game using the Oboe library, a C++ library that uses the high-performance audio APIs in the Android NDK. The objective of the game is to copy the clapping pattern you hear by tapping the screen.

Prerequisites
Basic knowledge of C++, including how to use header and implementation files.
What you'll do
Play sounds using the Oboe library.
Create low-latency audio streams.
Mix sounds together.
Trigger sounds precisely on a timeline.
Synchronize audio with the on-screen UI.
What you'll need
Android Studio 4.1 or higher
Android NDK and build tools installed
An Android device running Android Lollipop (API level 21) or higher for testing (Pixel devices are best for low-latency audio)

2. How do you play the game?

The game plays a funky four-beat backing track that continually loops. When the game starts, it also plays a clapping sound on the first three beats of the bar.

The user must try to repeat the three claps with the same timing by tapping the screen when the second bar begins.

Each time the user taps, the game plays a clap sound. If the tap happens at the right time, the screen flashes green. If the tap is too early or too late, the screen flashes orange or purple, respectively.

3. Get started

Clone project
Clone the Oboe repository on GitHub and switch to the game-codelab branch.


git clone https://github.com/google/oboe 
cd oboe
git checkout game-codelab
Open the project in Android Studio
Load Android Studio and open the codelab project:

File > Open...
Select the oboe/samples folder
Note: This project contains all the code samples for the Oboe library. For this codelab, you are only working with the RhythmGame sample.

Run the project
Choose the RhythmGame run configuration.

Press Control+R to build and run the template app. It should compile and run, but it doesn't do anything except turn the screen yellow. You add functionality to the game during this codelab.

Open the RhythmGame module
The files you work on for this codelab are stored in the RhythmGame module. Expand this module in the Project window, making sure that the Android view is selected.

Now expand the cpp/native-lib folder. During this codelab, you edit Game.h and Game.cpp.

Compare with the final version
During the codelab, it can be useful to refer to the final version of the code, which is stored in the master branch. Android Studio makes it easy to compare changes in files across branches.

Right click on a file in the Project view.
Go to git > Compare with Branch... > master

 Architecture overview

Here's the game architecture:

UI
The left side of the diagram shows objects associated with the UI.

The OpenGL Surface calls tick each time the screen needs to be updated, typically 60 times per second. Game then instructs any UI-rendering objects to render pixels to the OpenGL surface and the screen is updated.

The UI for the game is very simple: the single method SetGLScreenColor updates the color of the screen. The following colours are used to show what's happening in the game:

Yellow—game is loading.
Red—game failed to load.
Grey—game is running.
Orange—user tapped too early.
Green—user tapped on time.
Purple—user tapped too late.
Tap events
Each time the user taps the screen, the tap method is called, passing the time the event occurred.

Audio
The right side of the diagram shows objects associated with audio. Oboe provides the AudioStream class and associated objects to allow Game to send audio data to the audio output (a speaker or headphones).

Each time the AudioStream needs more data it calls AudioStreamDataCallback::onAudioReady. This passes an array named audioData to Game, which must then fill the array with numFrames of audio frames.
