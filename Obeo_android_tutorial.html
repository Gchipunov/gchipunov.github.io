1. Before you begin

This codelab is deprecated and will be removed soon.

In this codelab, you build a simple musical game using the Oboe library, a C++ library that uses the high-performance audio APIs in the Android NDK. The objective of the game is to copy the clapping pattern you hear by tapping the screen.

Prerequisites
Basic knowledge of C++, including how to use header and implementation files.
What you'll do
Play sounds using the Oboe library.
Create low-latency audio streams.
Mix sounds together.
Trigger sounds precisely on a timeline.
Synchronize audio with the on-screen UI.
What you'll need
Android Studio 4.1 or higher
Android NDK and build tools installed
An Android device running Android Lollipop (API level 21) or higher for testing (Pixel devices are best for low-latency audio)

2. How do you play the game?

The game plays a funky four-beat backing track that continually loops. When the game starts, it also plays a clapping sound on the first three beats of the bar.

The user must try to repeat the three claps with the same timing by tapping the screen when the second bar begins.

Each time the user taps, the game plays a clap sound. If the tap happens at the right time, the screen flashes green. If the tap is too early or too late, the screen flashes orange or purple, respectively.
