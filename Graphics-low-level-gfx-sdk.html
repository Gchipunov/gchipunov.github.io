The term "gfx-sdk" on GitHub refers to several projects, including a minimalist graphics API built on Direct3D12/HLSL (gboisse/gfx), a GooseFX SDK for platform integration (GooseFX1/gfx-ssl-sdk), and a wrapper around grep (dwisiswant0/gfx). 
Here's a breakdown of the different projects:
gboisse/gfx:
This is a minimalist and easy-to-use graphics API built on top of Direct3D12/HLSL, designed for rapid prototyping. It supports features like shader reflection, internal management of resources, garbage collection, and runtime shader reloading. 
GooseFX1/gfx-ssl-sdk:
This SDK contains APIs to integrate with the GooseFX platform. 
dwisiswant0/gfx:
This is a fork of gf, a wrapper around grep, with added features like flag expansion, globbing pattern name support, and concurrent operations. 
Other GFX-related projects:
