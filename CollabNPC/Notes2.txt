How to make npc in fps game control mouse and key board movement?
Excellent question! It gets to the core of how game AI works. The simple answer is that NPCs don't actually control a physical mouse and keyboard. Instead, programmers simulate those inputs by directly manipulating the NPC's character model through code.

The goal is to create an AI "brain" that decides where to move and aim, and then translates those decisions into smooth, human-like actions. Hereâ€™s how it's done.

1. The Core Concept: Simulation, Not Control

Think of the NPC as a puppet. The AI code is the puppeteer, not a player using a controller. Instead of sending a "W key pressed" signal, the code directly tells the game engine:

"Move this NPC character forward by X units this frame."

"Rotate this NPC's view to face direction (x,y,z)."

The challenge is making these coded actions look natural and intelligent. This is broken down into a few key systems.

2. The "Brain": Decision-Making ðŸ§ 

Before an NPC can move or aim, it needs to decide what to do. This is typically handled by a Finite State Machine (FSM). An FSM defines all the possible states an NPC can be in and the rules
