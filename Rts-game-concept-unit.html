RTS Game Unit Prompt: "Mobile Logistics Hub" (Supply Van)
Concept: A versatile, deployable vehicle serving as a forward logistics and resource management hub for your faction. It's not just a transport; it's a mobile mini-base that can significantly impact frontline operations.

Purpose:

Resource Collection: Can autonomously or semi-autonomously collect nearby scattered resources (e.g., salvage, energy crystals, rare minerals) at a slower rate than dedicated harvesters, but without needing a return trip to a main base.

Field Repair & Resupply: Provides limited repair capabilities for damaged vehicles and infantry, and can resupply ammunition or energy to units within a small radius.

Temporary Drop-off Point: Acts as a temporary resource drop-off point, allowing harvesters to deposit resources closer to the front lines, reducing travel time to the main base.

Mobile Command Node (Optional Upgrade): Can be upgraded to provide a minor command radius, boosting unit morale, sight range, or granting a small defensive bonus to nearby friendly units.

Appearance & Design:

Chassis: Imagine a heavily armored, multi-wheeled or tracked vehicle, similar in size to a large APC or a small tank, but with a more utilitarian, boxy superstructure. It should look robust and capable of traversing varied terrain.

Color Scheme: Reflects the faction's primary colors, perhaps with high-visibility markings (e.g., yellow stripes, faction insignia) indicating its support role.

Key Features:

Deployable Legs/Stabilizers: When deployed, it extends hydraulic legs or anchors to the ground, stabilizing itself and indicating its operational mode.

Retractable Collection Arms/Drones: Small robotic arms or compact drones can extend from its sides or top to pick up resources.

Antennae & Scanners: Prominent communication antennae and sensor arrays on the roof, emphasizing its role in logistics and information gathering.

Modular Bays: Visible hatches or panels on the sides, suggesting internal storage for supplies, spare parts, or even small deployable turrets (if upgraded).

Lighting: Utility lights that illuminate when deployed, creating a small operational zone.

Gameplay Mechanics:

Deployment: Requires a short deployment time to transition from mobile to operational mode. Cannot move while deployed.

Vulnerability: While deployed, it might gain a slight defensive bonus but is a high-priority target due to its support capabilities.

Capacity: Has a limited internal storage capacity for collected resources before needing to transfer them to a main depot or a larger resource hub.

Abilities:

"Field Scavenge": Toggles autonomous collection of nearby loose resources.

"Emergency Resupply": Activates a burst of repair/resupply for nearby units (on a cooldown).

"Relay Node" (Upgrade): Extends its sensor range or provides a minor buff to friendly units in its vicinity.

Strategic Role:
The Mobile Logistics Hub offers tactical flexibility, allowing players to sustain pushes, establish forward operating bases, and quickly exploit newly secured resource pockets without overextending their main supply lines. It encourages aggressive map control and dynamic resource management.
