Code in webgl physics water
Of course. Creating realistic physics-based water in WebGL is an advanced topic that combines physics simulation with rendering techniques. It's typically too complex for a single block of code, but I can provide a conceptual overview and commented code snippets for the key parts.

The core idea is to simulate the water's height map over time and then use this data in the rendering process to displace a plane mesh and apply realistic lighting and optical effects. A common approach for real-time applications is to use a simplified wave model or a grid-based simulation rather than a full fluid dynamics simulation, which is computationally expensive.

The Physics Simulation
One popular and efficient method involves treating the water surface as a 2D grid of interconnected points. The height of each point is affected by its neighbors. We can simulate the propagation of waves by using two buffers (textures) to store the height map of the water surface at the current and previous time steps.

The physics update, which can be done in a fragment shader for performance, calculates the new height of a point based on the heights of its neighbors in the previous frame. This is a simplified finite difference approximation of the wave equation.

The core update logic for a point at (x, y) is:

NewHeight(x, y) = ( (PreviousHeight(x+1, y) + PreviousHeight(x-1, y) + PreviousHeight(x, y+1) + PreviousHeight(x, y-1)) / 2 ) - CurrentHeight(x, y)

This formula calculates the average height of the neighboring points, doubles it, and subtracts the point's own previous height. The result is a new height that creates a ripple effect. A damping factor is usually applied to make the waves lose energy over time.

NewHeight *= DampingFactor

The Rendering Process
Once the physics simulation has updated the height map texture, we render the water surface.

Vertex Shader

The vertex shader's main job is to create the 3D wave motion. It samples the height map texture to get the current height for a given vertex on our water plane and displaces the vertex's Y-position accordingly. It also calculates the surface normal, which is crucial for lighting. The normal can be computed by sampling the heights of adjacent points in the height map.

Fragment Shader

The fragment shader handles the visual appearance of the water. This is where you implement lighting and optical effects to make it look realistic. Key effects include:

Reflection: Achieved by rendering the scene from a reflected camera angle into a texture (a render target) and then sampling that texture.

Refraction: Achieved by rendering the scene objects below the water into another texture and distorting the texture coordinates based on the water's normals (simulating how light bends as it passes through water).

Fresnel Effect: This effect makes reflections stronger at grazing angles and more transparent when looking straight down. It's calculated using the dot product between the view direction and the surface normal.

Specular Highlights: Simulates the glint of a light source (like the sun) on the water surface.

Code Implementation Example
Here are the key shader snippets. This assumes you have JavaScript code setting up a plane mesh, creating Framebuffer Objects (FBOs) to ping-pong between for the physics simulation, and passing the necessary uniforms (like textures, time, and camera position).

Physics Fragment Shader (for updating the height map)

This shader calculates the next state of the water surface.

OpenGL Shading Language
// physics.fs
precision mediump float;

varying vec2 v_texCoord;
uniform sampler2D u_watermap; // The height map from the previous frame
uniform vec2 u_delta; // The size of one pixel: (1.0 / textureWidth, 1.0 / textureHeight)

const float DAMPING = 0.995;

void main() {
    // Sample heights of neighboring pixels
    vec4 info = texture2D(u_watermap, v_texCoord);
    
    float center = texture2D(u_watermap, v_texCoord).x;
    float up = texture2D(u_watermap, v_texCoord + vec2(0.0, u_delta.y)).x;
    float down = texture2D(u_watermap, v_texCoord - vec2(0.0, u_delta.y)).x;
    float left = texture2D(u_watermap, v_texCoord - vec2(u_delta.x, 0.0)).x;
    float right = texture2D(u_watermap, v_texCoord + vec2(u_delta.x, 0.0)).x;

    // The 'y' component stores the previous height
    float oldHeight = info.y;

    // The simplified wave equation
    float newHeight = (up + down + left + right) / 2.0 - oldHeight;
    
    // Apply damping to make waves fade out
    newHeight *= DAMPING;

    // Store the new height in 'x' and the old height (current) in 'y' for the next pass
    gl_FragColor = vec4(newHeight, center, 0.0, 1.0);
}
Water Rendering Vertex Shader

This shader displaces the vertices of the water plane.

OpenGL Shading Language
// water.vs
attribute vec3 a_position;
attribute vec2 a_texCoord;

uniform mat4 u_projection;
uniform mat4 u_view;
uniform mat4 u_world;

uniform sampler2D u_watermap; // The final height map from the physics simulation

varying vec3 v_worldPosition;
varying vec2 v_texCoord;
varying vec3 v_normal;

void main() {
    v_texCoord = a_texCoord;
    
    // Get height from the physics texture
    float height = texture2D(u_watermap, a_texCoord).x;

    // Displace the vertex position
    vec3 displacedPosition = a_position + vec3(0.0, height, 0.0);
    
    // Calculate normals for lighting by sampling neighboring heights
    float hL = texture2D(u_watermap, a_texCoord - vec2(0.01, 0.0)).x;
    float hR = texture2D(u_watermap, a_texCoord + vec2(0.01, 0.0)).x;
    float hD = texture2D(u_watermap, a_texCoord - vec2(0.0, 0.01)).x;
    float hU = texture2D(u_watermap, a_texCoord + vec2(0.0, 0.01)).x;

    v_normal = normalize(vec3(hL - hR, 2.0, hD - hU));
    
    // Standard MVP transformation
    gl_Position = u_projection * u_view * u_world * vec4(displacedPosition, 1.0);
    v_worldPosition = (u_world * vec4(displacedPosition, 1.0)).xyz;
}
Water Rendering Fragment Shader

This shader calculates the final color of the water, incorporating reflections, etc.

OpenGL Shading Language
// water.fs
precision mediump float;

uniform sampler2D u_reflectionTexture;
uniform sampler2D u_refractionTexture;
uniform vec3 u_cameraPosition;
uniform vec3 u_lightDirection;

varying vec3 v_worldPosition;
varying vec3 v_normal;
varying vec2 v_texCoord; // Assuming this is screen-space projection for reflection/refraction

void main() {
    vec3 viewDirection = normalize(u_cameraPosition - v_worldPosition);
    vec3 normal = normalize(v_normal);

    // Fresnel effect
    float fresnel = pow(1.0 - max(0.0, dot(viewDirection, normal)), 3.0);
    
    // Reflection color
    vec3 reflectionColor = texture2D(u_reflectionTexture, v_texCoord).rgb;
    
    // Refraction color
    vec3 refractionColor = texture2D(u_refractionTexture, v_texCoord).rgb;
    
    // Combine using fresnel
    vec3 surfaceColor = mix(refractionColor, reflectionColor, fresnel);
    
    // Add some specular lighting
    vec3 reflectDir = reflect(-u_lightDirection, normal);
    float spec = pow(max(dot(viewDirection, reflectDir), 0.0), 32.0);
    vec3 specular = vec3(1.0) * spec;

    gl_FragColor = vec4(surfaceColor + specular, 1.0);
}
